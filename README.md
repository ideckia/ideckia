# ideckia

This repository is only to get all the pieces from their own repositories together, server and actions.

## Try this project

### Server

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ideckia/ideckia/releases/). This will run the server in your machine. Now you need a [client](#client) to tell the server what to do.

### Actions

There are some actions created in the [github](https://github.com/ideckia). Download the releases and unzip them in the `actions` folder.

### Client

#### Local web client

Here is a very basic [React web client](https://github.com/ideckia/web_client) to run and test in local. Clone the repo and run `npm run start`.

#### Mobile client

Also exists a [mobile client](https://github.com/ideckia/mobile_client).

* [Download the release](https://github.com/ideckia/mobile_client/releases) and install it in your mobile.
* Connect the mobile to the same network where the server is running.
* When you launch the app it should detect the server.
